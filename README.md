# advent-of-code
In this project we solved 6 algorithmic puzzles from [adventofcode.com](www.adventofcode.com). Each puzzle has two parts. We called them _a_ and _b_.
Please find below each puzzle's content:

- [Day 1](https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/1)
- [Day 2](https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/2)
- [Day 4](https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/4)
- [Day 5](https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/5)
- [Day 11](https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/11)
- [Day 15](https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/15)

## Running the program
To run the program you need to pass two arguments: puzzle's number and input data.

For instance:

`stack exec advent-of-code-exe Day1b input\Day1.txt`

will run the second part of [Day 1 puzzle](https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/1) with _Day1.txt_ as an input.
