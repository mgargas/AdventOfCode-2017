# advent-of-code
In this project we solved 6 algorithmic puzzles from website adventofcode.com. Each puzzle has two parts. We called them "a" and "b".
Here you can find each puzzle's content:
Day1 - https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/1
Day2 - https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/2
Day4 - https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/4
Day5 - https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/5
Day11 - https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/11
Day15 - https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/15
To run this program you have to pass two arguments: puzzle's number and input data. For example:
stack exec advent-of-code-exe Day1b input\Day1.txt - it will run second part of Day1 puzzle with Day1.tzt as input
